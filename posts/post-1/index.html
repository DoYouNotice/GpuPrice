                                                                  <li> Block tld (.email)

                </p>
                <h3> Privacy nextdns</h3>
                <p>
                    <li> Lets u block tracker that are operating at the system level from xiaomi, huawei, samsung, alexa, windows, apple, roku, and sonos
                
                        <li>Block third party trackers disgusing them self as first party
                
                            <li>    Lets you route a dns to a different one (didnt try it) but i think u can basically make reddit go to libreddit
                
                                <li> Nextdns has a blocklist thats lets u block all google service not sure if adguards has something like that but u can probably just copy and import the list to adguard
                
                Design
                
                <li>    Both look clean but i think adguard looks better. Besides that, the blocklist on adguard looks much better and has a better categorzation
                
                    <li>  Conclusion
                
                        <li>  Both of them are good ( as for there claims)
                
                            <li>    One thing i really didnt like is that nextdns claims to not log by default which makes there privacy policy untrustful. (Logging turned on by default)
                
                                <li>    If we would say that we can trust nextdns basically claming not logging, or selling any data than defentily we should go for nextdns for now.
                
                                    <li>  When using nextdns make sure to turn off logging in the settings
                
                                        <li>  If you dont like them (or trust them) you can go for adguard but you will missing features for privacy and security. I like that adguard makes it pretty clear that they only use anonymoized data and share only ad , tracking or malware domains.
                
                                            <li>   When using adguard you can turn off log dns requests in the account settings but this might me only for you (not sure if they still have logs)
                
                                                <li>  Remember that adguard dns is still in beta.
